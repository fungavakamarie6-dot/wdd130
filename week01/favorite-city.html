    <title>My Favorite City: Shanghai, China</title>

    <h1>Shanghai, China</h1>

    <p>
        Shanghai is a global metropolis and financial hub, often called the "Pearl of the Orient."
        It is renowned for its magnificent skyline along the Huangpu River, especially the futuristic
        towers in the Lujiazui area of Pudong.
    </p>

    <p>
        The city beautifully preserves its history, from the colonial architecture of **The Bund** to the traditional
        gardens and alleyways of the Old City. The contrast between these historic
        sites and the modern skyscrapers makes Shanghai truly unique.
